# FILAMENT SENSORS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define the pins for optional sensors in the filament path. All but the pre-gate sensors will be automatically setup as
# both endstops (for homing) and sensors for visibility purposes.
#
# 'pre_gate_switch_pin_X' .. 'mmu_pre_gate_X` sensor detects filament at entry to MMU. X=gate number (0..N)
# 'gate_switch_pin'       .. 'mmu_gate' sensor detects filament at the gate of the MMU
# 'toolhead_switch_pin'   .. 'toolhead' sensor detects filament after extruder entry
# 'extruder_switch_pin'   .. 'extruder' sensor detects filament just before the extruder entry
#
# Sync motor feedback will typically have a tension switch (more important) or both tension and compression
# 'sync_feedback_tension_pin'     .. pin for switch activated when filament is under tension
# 'sync_feedback_compression_pin' .. pin for switch activated when filament is under compression
#
# Simply define pins for any sensor you want to enable, if pin is not set (or the alias is empty) it will be ignored.
# You can also just comment out what you are not using

pin: mmu:MMU_NEOPIXEL
chain_count: 6			# Number gates x1 or x2 + 1 (if you want status)
color_order: GRB		# Set based on your particular neopixel specification


# MMU LED EFFECT SEGMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define neopixel LEDs for your MMU. The chain_count must be large enough for your desired ranges:
#   exit   .. this set of LEDs, one for every gate, usually would be mounted at the exit point of the gate
#   entry  .. this set of LEDs, one for every gate, could be mounted at the entry point of filament into the MMU/buffer
#   status .. this single LED represents the status of the currently selected filament
#
# Note that all sets are optional. You can opt simple to have just the 'exit' set for example. The advantage to having
# both entry and exit LEDs is, for example, so that 'entry' can display gate status while 'exit' displays the color
# 
# The effects requires the installation of Julian Schill's awesome LED effect module:
#   https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect
# LED's are indexed in the chain from 1..N. Thus to set up LED's on 'exit' and a single 'status' LED on a 4 gate MMU:
#   exit_range:   1-4
#   status_index: 5
# In this example no 'entry' set is configured.
#
# Note the range order is important and depends on your wiring. Thus 1-4 and 4-1 both represent the same LED range
# but mapped to increasing or decreasing gates respectively
#
# Note that Happy Hare provides a convenience wrapper [mmu_led_effect] that not only creates an effect on each of the
# [mmu_leds] specified segments but also each individual LED for atomic control. See mmu_leds.cfg for examples
